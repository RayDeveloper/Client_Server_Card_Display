The purpose of the program is to obtain card information from the user and display it on screen using graphics. The program uses a while statement that stays for “While (true)”. An extra feature was implemented, where once ‘high’ is entered it displays the current high score. If during the program execution the high score is beaten, the new high score is registered.
